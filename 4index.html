    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m a UX/UI Designer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
        I have experience in redesign and product 
        development and have a passion for creating the 
        best product for users. My strong attention to 
        detail and work ethic contribute to providing my
        best work, as well as my desire to constantly 
        improve my skills. I’m fun to work with and eager
        to join a team and work on more projects.
    <br>
    <br>
        Currently, I am finishing up a 6-month Bootcamp
        for UX/UI Design. I will have UX/UI experience in
        several projects as well as some basic front-end
        knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    <br>
    <br>
        I love music and the outdoors, spending time with
        my family, and the fall.</p>
